# Project Overview
This is a semester project for stats 216. It involves a statistical analysis on the data set homeless_prep.csv.

These four question are -

* Is there a difference in ages in homelessness when it comes to abuse? (Aron Chen)
* Which age of veterans are most likely to be homeless? (Niko Bougiotopoulos)
* How does age affect the length of stay in homeless shelters? (Nicolas Halstead)
* How does income affect the likelihood of substance abuse? (Madi Phillips)
